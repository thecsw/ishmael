* Ishmael's Moby üêã

Welcome, Ishmael. This is your website built with [[https://github.com/thecsw/darkness][darkness]]. Let me give you a
tour of all the incredible adventures that are waiting for you beyond the
horizon. What you see here right now, is a simple block of text.

** Sections

Every darkness input should start with the page's title. Page's title will look
in the form of =* Page's title= and every section on the website will start with
two or more astericks to show the heading level. So, =** Section= and =***
Subsection= will be put as a child of the former. 

** Formatting

You can separate text into paragraphs by adding a new line between them. Think
of an empty line as a delimeter. You should always add it between different
types of blocks you add to your page.

Simple formatting is supported as well, you can do some *bold* text, maybe even
/italics/, and =verbatim=. For =*bold*=, surround your text with astericks, for
=/italics/=, surround with forward slashes, and verbatim with equal signs,
==verbatim==

** Links and embeds

Links are in the form of =[¬≠[link][text]]=. If your link is in a text, then it will
show up as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishmael_(Moby-Dick)][such]]. If the link is on a separate line, darkness will decide if it
can be inserted as an embed (image, youtube, spotify song/playlist, video,
audio).

*** Images
See for example, below is a link on its line with an image path

[[evangelion.webp][/CUT/, August 2009 issue. Art by Tadashi Hiramatsu]]

*** Songs
Depending on the link type, darkness will intelligently stub in a preview if
it's a standalone link (not inlined within text). One more example

[[https://open.spotify.com/track/4cPnNnTMkJ6soUOUzEtmcp?si=ba1730fdb66642b9][Last Surprise]]

** Lists

Lists are created by starting a line with a hyphen followed by an item
description, you would write something like

#+begin_src
  - This is my first item
  - This second item is going to be so long that I would
  have to break it down into two line
  - Third item follows swiftly
#+end_src

It will render as follows

- This is my first item
- This second item is going to be so long that I would
  have to break it down into two line
- Third item follows swiftly

** Source code blocks

Source code blocks follow [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Working-with-Source-Code.html][orgmode]]'s conventions. You would wrap your source code
with =#+begin_src LANG= and =#+end_src=, where =LANG= is the language of the source
code block. You can leave =LANG= empty as well. 

#+begin_src org
  ,#+begin_src c
  main( ) {
          printf("hello, world");
  }
  ,#+end_src
#+end_src

Will render as (hover over the block to see the language)

#+begin_src c
  main( ) {
          printf("hello, world");
  }
#+end_src

** HTML injection

Whatever darkness provides can still be limiting if you want to insert some of
your own material or embeds that are not supported. Do you give up? Hopefully
not. Anything surrounded by =#+begin_export html= and =#+end_export= will be inserted
literally into the page. 

#+begin_export html
<script src="https://gist.github.com/thecsw/c80f83c0d52c0a476e86fc9a6a980517.js"></script>
#+end_export

This is the embed source for the above

#+begin_src org
  ,#+begin_export html
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/thecsw/c80f83c0d52c0a476e86fc9a6a980517.js"></script>
  ,#+end_export
#+end_src

** Attention blocks

You may need to grab reader's attention even more or make them aware of some
sharp edges in whatever you're writing about. Start a paragraph with =NOTE:=,
=IMPORTANT:=, =CAUTION:=, =TIP:=, or =WARNING:=, and you will get an attention-grabber

TIP: This is kinda useful for technical posts when you mention exceptions or so 

** Footnotes

Another cool thing darkness can do for you is keeping track of your
footnotes. We follow orgmode's conventions as well. Anywhere in the text, if
you have a string in the form of =[fn¬≠:: blablabla]=, that =blablabla= will go and
become your footnote. [fn:: /Formatting/ *also* =works= in footnotes]
