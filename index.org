* Ishmael's Moby üêã

Welcome, Ishmael. This is your website built with [[https://github.com/thecsw/darkness][darkness]]. Let me give you a
tour of all the incredible adventures that are waiting for you beyond the
horizon. What you see here right now, is a simple block of text.

** Sections

Every darkness input should start with the page's title. Page's title will look
in the form of =* Page's title= and every section on the website will start with
two or more astericks to show the heading level. So, =** Section= and =***
Subsection= will be put as a child of the former. 

** Formatting

You can separate text into paragraphs by adding a new line between them. Think
of an empty line as a delimeter. You should always add it between different
types of blocks you add to your page.

Simple formatting is supported as well, you can do some *bold* text, maybe even
/italics/, and =verbatim=. For *bold*, surround your text with astericks, for
=/italics/=, surround with forward slashes, and verbatim with equal signs,
==verbatim= = or =~code~=

Some new ones were added, such as +strike-through+ (=¬≠+strike-through+=) and
_underline_ (=_underline_=).

** Links and embeds

Links are in the form of =[¬≠[link][text]]=. If your link is in a text, then it will
show up as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishmael_(Moby-Dick)][such]]. If the link is on a separate line, darkness will decide if it
can be inserted as an embed (image, youtube, spotify song/playlist, video,
audio).

*** Images

See for example, below is a link on its line with an image path

[[https://sandyuraz.com/ishmael/evangelion.webp][/CUT/, August 2009 issue. Art by Tadashi Hiramatsu]]

*** Songs

Depending on the link type, darkness will intelligently stub in a preview if
it's a standalone link (not inlined within text). One more example

[[https://open.spotify.com/track/4cPnNnTMkJ6soUOUzEtmcp?si=ba1730fdb66642b9][Last Surprise]]

*** YouTube videos

If you just have a youtube link by itself on a line, it will embed the video
player in a responsive container and everything! (embeds might not work locally,
you would need to push it somewhere)

** Galleries

You can begin galleries with =#+begin_gallery= and =#+end_gallery= environment. Each
image should be in a list. You can pass an optional =:num N= to the =begin_gallery=
to define the custom number of flex elements per row (defaults to 3). You can
even change the width of each list element manually by passing =:flex W= parameter
in the list line, where =W= is the percentage in increments of 5 starting from 30.

#+end_gallery

Here is an example of a custom width element to have that *woah* effect.

#+begin_gallery
- [[https://bnz05pap002files.storage.live.com/y4m2HWgOkw9eIONyUXY6lP323tw0bR2D4A7YRfhNJAtItxq4STIVSH7Hgc00i31jovKBbtj-82oOVywmYEVo1uDsi7DkFcCkAjxd0X14zmFMthLpP47I2ibRxeZlL7TmrdFk0v8z29sG4v_xsfChi4OzISy2ooorY0QEpO_XNhlt9w-PBKn1oxCWneGXs8iy2c-?width=4032&height=2268&cropmode=none][Rem and Ram "custom flex width here"]] :flex 95
#+end_gallery

You can also improve user's experience by generating /very cheap/ (around 10KB
size) preview images, so that the DOM space is cheaply laid out before the full
image has a chance to load. =misa= subcommand (run =-help=) provides quality of life
improvements that are *extra* to the build.

#+begin_src sh
  darkness misa -gallery-previews
#+end_src

** Lists

Lists are created by starting a line with a hyphen followed by an item
description, you would write something like

#+begin_src
  - This is my first item
  - This second item is going to be so long that I would
  have to break it down into two line
  - Third item follows swiftly
#+end_src

It will render as follows

- This is my first item
- This second item is going to be so long that I would
  have to break it down into two line
- Third item follows swiftly

** Source code blocks

Source code blocks follow [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Working-with-Source-Code.html][orgmode]]'s conventions. You would wrap your source code
with =#+begin_src LANG= and =#+end_src=, where =LANG= is the language of the source
code block. You can leave =LANG= empty as well. 

Will render as (hover over the block to see the language)

#+begin_src c
  /* you always say hi but it never replies */
  main( ) {
          printf("hello, world");
  }
#+end_src

** Special environments

You can center text or add quotes org-mode style with =#+¬≠begin_center=
and =#+¬≠end_center=, so

#+begin_center
it would look like this
#+end_center

or you can also wrap your quotes in =#+¬≠begin_quote= with =#+¬≠end_quote= for the
following,

#+begin_quote
There is nothing more awful, insulting, and depressing than banality.

-- Anton Chekhov
#+end_quote

or you can have details with =#+¬≠begin_details <NAME>= and =#+¬≠end_details=,

#+begin_details this is the title
ha! you found me
#+end_details

** HTML injection

Whatever darkness provides can still be limiting if you want to insert some of
your own material or embeds that are not supported. Do you give up? Hopefully
not. Anything surrounded by =#+begin_export html= and =#+end_export= will be inserted
literally into the page. 

#+begin_export html
<script src="https://gist.github.com/thecsw/c80f83c0d52c0a476e86fc9a6a980517.js"></script>
#+end_export

Simply wrap any raw HTML (like =script= tags) in =#+begin_export html= and
=#+end_export= if you want the code injected within the ~article~ container
or =#+begin_export html_raw= to inject it in the root DOM.

** Attention blocks

You may need to grab reader's attention even more or make them aware of some
sharp edges in whatever you're writing about. Start a paragraph with =NOTE:=,
=IMPORTANT:=, =CAUTION:=, =TIP:=, or =WARNING:=, and you will get an attention-grabber

TIP: This is kinda useful for technical posts when you mention exceptions or so 

IMPORTANT: Life is to be lived.

** Footnotes

Another cool thing darkness can do for you is keeping track of your
footnotes. We follow orgmode's conventions as well. Anywhere in the text, if
you have a string in the form of =[fn¬≠:: blablabla]=, that =blablabla= will go and
become your footnote. [fn:: /Formatting/ *also* =works= in footnotes]

** Tables

Tables are super cool, by making an orgmode table and /optionally/ adding a
caption above it with =#+caption: blablabla=, we can get the following,

#+caption: This is my very cool table
| Name     | Origin                 | Waifu?       |
|----------+------------------------+--------------|
| Rem      | Re:Rezo                | YES YES YES  |
| Aqua     | Konosuba               | *Absolutely.*  |
| Zero Two | Darling in the FRANXX  | =no other way= |
| Najimi   | Komi Can't Communicate | /yes/          |

** Drop caps

#+drop_cap
Drop a nice =#+drop_cap= above any paragraph and it will make this nice /old style/
section division.
